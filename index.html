    <!--Adding Images-->
        <!--Before adding an image, first drag it into the same folder as this index.html folder-->
        <!--Could leave as <img src="goomba.png"> if it were in same folder, but if there is a subfolder full of images, heres how to access that -->
        <img src="/images/goomba.png" height="300" alt="This is an image of a goomba" title="goomba"> <!--replace "images" with the name of the folder-->
            <!--Can also add "width" to change image width-->
            <!--the alt section is good for people with screen readers and should always be used on images-->

        <!--Now to add a hyper link-->
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba" target="_blank">
        <img src="/images/goomba.png" height="300" alt="This is an image of a goomba" title="goomba">
